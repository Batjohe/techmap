# Contributing to Honeypot's Tech Map

Honeypot is Europe’s developer-focused job platform. We are on a mission to get every developer a great job. To create the London Tech Map, we looked through 12,000 developer job postings and the tech stacks of over 800 London companies. Developers can view companies by industry, location and programming language.

Contribute to add your company’s tech stack and location or suggest changes to current information. We made this open source because our mission is get every developer a great job.
